	Lokon High School started in 1976 as an integrated school at Jalan Tiga Ribu, housing pupils from three different streams English, Chinese and Malay.
	In the 1980s, the school made a name for itself in Track & Field holding the title of Overall Divisional Champions for Girls from 1980 to 1990.
	The Malay stream and Chinese stream were phased out in 1993 and 1996 respectively.<br><br>
	35 years later, on 28 December 2011, 870 students moved into its brand new 3.3 hectares campus at 21 Simei Street 4 with fully equipped facilities.
	The school is also equipped with handicap friendly facilities.
	Since its move to the new location, Lokon High School has become more popular as a choice institute.<br><br>
	Lokon High School is located in the East Coast GRC(Changi Simei) and also falls under the South East Community Development Council District (CDC).
	The council has actively engaged the school in joint community projects and other enrichment activities.
